EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Spain's economic activity is expected to contract by 1.8%, and by 0.3% in 2013. Unemployment is foreseen to increase further to 25.1% in 2013, also for the young. Spain has recently adopted ambitious reforms, including in key areas such as the financial sector, the labour market and collective bargaining. It also introduced legislation to strengthen the fiscal framework and reformed pensions. Reflecting the outstanding challenges, Spain has announced comprehensive and far-reaching plans for further measures to strengthen fiscal discipline and enhance competitiveness to boost the country's growth. Spain continues to face important policy challenges following the bursting of the housing and credit bubble. Further fiscal consolidation and fiscal discipline at regional level are necessary to restore market confidence and to halt the rapid increase in government debt. The tax structure lacks efficiency and there is room for making the tax system more growth friendly. The banking sector remains fragile due to high private and corporate debt levels. Low levels of competition in sheltered sectors such as professional services and retail, sluggish adjustment of prices and wages and low productivity growth hamper the economic recovery and the re-orientation of the Spanish economy towards a new growth model. Unemployment has reached a record high, and employability and labour market segmentation constitute significant bottlenecks. Problems in the education system include low levels of achievement at secondary level, too many students leaving school early and a vocational training system insufficiently tailored to market needs. 3
