EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Malta's economic activity is expected to slow down compared to 2011, regaining momentum in 2013. GDP growth is projected to decrease to 1.2% according to the Commission services’ 2012 spring forecast. The unemployment rate of is projected to remain well below the euro-area average at 6.6%.  The Maltese economy continues to perform relatively well. Malta's general government deficit is reported to have been below 3% of GDP in 2011. Malta has also invested to better adapt its education system to industry requirements. A series of initiatives were launched in the energy field to reduce the dependency on imported oil, increase the share of renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency, though they are still at a relatively early stage of development. Malta's challenges remain broadly unchanged. Concrete progress on strengthening the fiscal framework and adopting additional consolidation measures has been limited. The projected long-term increase in age-related expenditure poses a risk to the long-term sustainability of its public finances. The underutilisation of its human capital, namely of older workers and women, adds to the scope of the challenge. Strengthening labour skills and reducing Malta's high rate of early school leaving remain high on the agenda. Malta's mandatory cost-of-living adjustment mechanism may hamper its competitiveness, especially in labour-intensive sectors. Tackling the very high dependence on imported oil remains a challenge. Finally, the large exposure of its banking system to the real estate market poses potential risks. 3
