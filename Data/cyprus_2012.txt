EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Cyprus's economic activity is expected to contract by 0.8% in 2012, before regaining some momentum in 2013 to reach 0.3% of GDP. Unemployment is foreseen to increase further to 9.8% in 2012. To ensure sound public finances, Cyprus has adopted a series of consolidation measures, committing to the reduction of its fiscal deficit. Legislation has also been put in place to accommodate, via public intervention, risks to the viability of banks or needs for recapitalisation that cannot be met by market operations. As response to the economy's contraction, the government also adopted a wide-ranging package of measure to enhance the country's growth potential, employment, productivity, and competitiveness. Measures were taken to reform the pension system and a social dialogue is currently under way regarding the reform of the wage indexation system. Despite these efforts, Cyprus is affected by sizeable and persistent current account deficits, large amount of accumulated private sector debt, widening annual deficits of public finances and the large exposure to Greece of the banking sector. Tax collection is marked by inefficiencies that give rise to tax evasion. A comprehensive pension reform is needed to address the inherent sustainability as well as adequacy problems of the system, given the high poverty risk among the elderly. The healthcare system is characterised by inequity and inefficiencies. Unemployment is on the rise, reaching historically high figures, especially for young people and the labour market is characterised by an inadequate supply of skills to match current and future labour demand. Obstacles in the services market and to the provision of professional services remain. 3
