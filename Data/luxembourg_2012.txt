EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Luxemburg's growth expectations are modest, with an average GDP growth slightly above 1% in 2012, followed by an acceleration to around 2% in 2013. Job creation is slowing down since the end of 2011. As a result, the unemployment rate started rising again, and is expected to reach a historic high of around 6% in 2013.  Luxembourg has announced a fiscal consolidation package of around 1.2% of GDP for 2013. The government also proposed a pension reform which is currently debated in the parliament. The application of the automatic indexation of wages has been limited between 2012 and 2014 and steps were taken to tackle the relatively high youth unemployment. The commonly agreed indicator for long-term fiscal sustainability (S2) is among the highest in the EU, posing a pressing challenge which is largely due to the expected increase in pension expenditure. In order to remain competitive, unit labour costs will need to evolve more in line with developments in productivity and competitiveness. The heavy dependence of the economy and public finances on the financial sector is a structural risk for the country. The youth unemployment rate is relatively high in Luxembourg, when comparing to the low overall unemployment rate. LuxembourgÕs education system faces specific challenges due to the multilingualism demands of the system, the high proportion of immigrants in the population, and the high demand for skilled workers on the labour market, which need to be tackled. Finally, Luxembourg does not appear to be on track to reach its Europe 2020 target for non-ETS greenhouse gas emission reduction. 3
