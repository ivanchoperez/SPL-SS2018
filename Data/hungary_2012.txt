 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, the economic activity of Hungary is expected to contract by 0.3%, before regaining some momentum in 2013. Unemployment is foreseen to slightly decrease to 10.6% in 2012 and to fall further in 2013. In the context of the overall consolidation process and following a Council decision in January 2012 that Hungary had not taken effective action, the government undertook efforts to secure the budgetary targets for 2012 and also in 2013 when substantial one-off revenues are phased out. There have been first steps to broaden the remit of the Fiscal Council but it still does not include crucial tasks and multiannual fiscal planning remains indicative. Further, the Hungarian government has pursued an extensive structural reform agenda including key elements targeting the labour market as well as steps to reform the business environment. In several areas, policy responses remained rather incomplete. Hungary continues to face serious challenges in the short to medium term. The attainment of the deficit target of 2.5% of GDP in 2012 and 2.2% of GDP in 2013 will have to be ensured in a sustainable way. The already adopted cardinal law on economic stability does not include a binding medium-term budgetary framework. Further, the recent tax changes have negatively impacted low earners and have therefore not contributed to enhancing employment. The public employment service has been reorganised resulting in an overall downsizing, pointing in the opposite direction of what was recommended in 2011. A further challenge relates to the transparency and quality of public administration, where Hungary ranks low on many indicators. The equity and effectiveness of the school system is also of concern, especially with regard to recent legislative changes that risk increasing the number of early school leavers and segregation in the Hungarian school system. 3
