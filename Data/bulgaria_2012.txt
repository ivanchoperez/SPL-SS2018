EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Real GDP growth in Bulgaria is expected to remain rather low in the first half of 2012, but to accelerate gradually thereafter to reach an annual growth of 0.5% in 2012 and 1.9% in 2013. Unemployment is expected to increase in 2012 to 12.0% of the labour force. Bulgaria managed to reduce the fiscal deficit as required under the Excessive Deficit Procedure and it is implementing a major reform that aims at raising the statutory retirement age for men and women.  Despite the progress the government has made in implementing its reform agenda, the main policy challenges for the country have remained broadly unchanged. A persistent increase in unemployment calls for a stronger re-orientation of active labour market policy to improve employability. The low educational achievements signal the existence of considerable structural obstacles to ensuring quality education. The sustainability and adequacy of the pensions system is not fully ensured yet. The quality of public spending, the efficiency of the tax system and the business climate are suboptimal. Bulgaria is largely dependent on imported energy and its domestic energy market is not fully operational. 3
