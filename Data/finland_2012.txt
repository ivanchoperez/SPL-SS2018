EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Finland's economic activity is expected to grow by 0.8% and by 1.6% in 2013. Unemployment is foreseen stay at 8%. Finland has experienced a strong recovery in recent years and economic fundamentals remain strong. The country is on track for balancing the general government finances by 2015. and it is taking steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances (e.g. by introducing a reform to reorganize the municipal sector). However, Finland is facing important challenges with respect to the long-term sustainability of the current standard of living due to an ageing population, industrial restructuring and a loss of competitiveness on international markets. For the first time in nearly 20 years, the current account turned into deficit in 2011 and is expected to remain in deficit in 2012. Strengthening competition in product and services market has become increasingly important for boosting productivity and enhancing potential economic growth. Notwithstanding the past strong Finnish R&D and innovation performance, without a significant increase in the number of internationalising innovative high growth firms, FinlandÕs ranking as an EU innovation leader risks declining. There is continued need to lengthen working careers and to combat the rise in long-term unemployment as well as youth unemployment. 3
