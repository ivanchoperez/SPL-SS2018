EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Portugal's economic activity is expected to contract by 3.3% in 2012 before regaining some momentum in 2013 with a prevision of 0.3%. The labour market situation worsened significantly. The unemployment rate reached 15% in February 2012 and is set to increase further this year. Portugal is making progress on a number of fronts. The government is undertaking a number of reforms to improve fiscal management and expenditure control, and is pursuing its privatisation plans. A major reform of the labour market has been submitted for Parliament's approval, and measures are underway to improve activation and other active labour market policies. Portugal recently launched a Youth Strategy aiming at addressing the high share of youth unemployment (34%). A strategic re-programming of the Structural Funds is also underway, with a focus on support to youth employment and competitiveness, in particular SMEs. Portugal nevertheless continues to face significant challenges. Achieving the fiscal targets remains essential for the government to regain full market access within the Programme period. To limit the risks to the 2012 fiscal targets a rapid and determined implementation of the structural-fiscal measures of the Programme is paramount. At the same time, the government needs to focus on reforms that address Portugal's competitiveness challenges. The 2012 budget does not pursue earlier plans of a 'fiscal devaluation'. This makes it all the more important to adopt rapidly structural reforms in labour and product markets with a view to reducing labour cost, increasing flexibility, lowering entry barriers and tackling rent-seeking. 3
