EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Poland's economic activity is expected to slow down as compared to 2011. Nevertheless, GDP growth is still projected to increase by 2.7%. Unemployment is foreseen to slightly rise to 9.8%. Poland's public finances are improving. Helped by solid economic growth in 2011, Poland has reduced its budget deficit in line with the Commission's recommendations. The parliament adopted a major reform of the country's pension system, which would gradually rise the statutory retirement age to 67. In other areas however, reform efforts have been limited, particularly as regards the labour market, education, energy, transport and regulation.  In the medium to long term, Poland is faced with a number of challenges. The budget deficit has to be further reduced to reach the medium-term objective. Financial markets require continued attention. A very low labour force participation rate, in particular women, and the quality of vocational training and education are major concerns given an ageing population. There are also signs of labour market segmentation affecting the youth. The low level of public and private R&D spending, weak links between science and industry and the poor innovation performance call for improvements. Poland's infrastructure, particularly its railway and energy system, remains underdeveloped. The efficiency of public administration, tax collection and law-making needs to be significantly improved. Unjustified restrictions in the field of professional services impede economic growth. . 3
