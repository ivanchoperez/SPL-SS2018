EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, the Danish economy is expected to pick up slightly as compared to 2011, with a foreseen GDP growth of 1.1%. Unemployment more than doubled from a record low of 3.4% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2011 and is expected to remain broadly stable in 2012 at 7.7%.  A reform of the voluntary early retirement pension scheme was adopted last year, establishing a good basis for raising the effective retirement age. In addition, an ambitious budget law was recently agreed. The government has announced a comprehensive set of reforms to raise labour supply further, improve competitiveness, and lower income taxes.  The budget deficit must be reduced to comply with the EDP recommendation and further reforms are warranted to increase the labour supply. The quality of compulsory and upper secondary education needs to be improved to tackle problems of future skills imbalances and low productivity growth. In this respect, further steps are also warranted to remove obstacles to competition. In addition, strengthening the medium-term stability of the housing market remains a challenge, partly on account of the rise in household debt and its composition on the back of the housing boom prior to the crisis. 3
