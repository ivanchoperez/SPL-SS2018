EXECUTIVE SUMMARY After a strong rebound in 2011, Lithuania's economic activity is expected to increase by 2.4% in 2012. Unemployment is foreseen to decrease gradually from its former peaks to 13.8% in 2012; however, unemployment remains high particularly among young and unskilled workers. Helped by robust economic growth in 2011, Lithuania's general government deficit narrowed to 5.5% of GDP, and is expected to decrease further to 3.2% of GDP in 2012. Lithuania made progress in improving tax collection and reforming its state-owned enterprises. Lithuania continues to face important policy challenges:  demographic developments cast a doubt on Lithuania’s long-term fiscal sustainability, especially of its pension system. A low labour force participation rate, very high youth unemployment, shortage of skilled labour and skill mismatches, aggravated by high emigration, are other major concerns in the medium to long term. The growing poverty and social exclusion threatens to put an even higher strain on public finances in the near future. The country’s infrastructure, particularly its energy system, lacks competition and interconnections, thus hindering growth. Low energy efficiency, especially of buildings, as well as the low level of R&D spending and poor performance in innovation, are pressing issues. Modernising public administration and finalising the reform of state-owned enterprises are also essential to boosting competitiveness. 3
