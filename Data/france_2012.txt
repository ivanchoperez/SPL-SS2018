Executive summary In 2012, France's economic activity is expected to grow by 0.5%, before regaining momentum in 2013 to reach 1.3%. Unemployment is foreseen to increase further to 10.2%.  In the last two years, France overachieved its deficit targets but the public deficit remains too high and debt is growing. The development of the minimum wage has been contained and measures to promote apprenticeship and help older people find a job have been undertaken. Measures were taken to reduce tax expenditures and to lower labour taxation. Budgetary consolidation remains an important policy challenge in France. While this year's deficit target appears attainable, the distance to the 3% of GDP threshold to be achieved in 2013 remains significant. The tax system can be made more conducive to sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. The long-term sustainability and adequacy of the pension system requires careful monitoring. The level of segmentation of the labour market remains high and young people are particularly affected.  There are risks related to the long.term impact of unemployment on human capital, given that participation in life-long learning remains low and the capacity of the public employment service is strained. The competitiveness of French businesses remains a significant challenge, and competition, particularly in the retail sector and in the network industries, is sub-optimal. 3
