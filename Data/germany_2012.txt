EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Germany's economic activity is expected to significantly slow down as compared to 2011. Real GDP is projected to increase by 0.7%. Unemployment is foreseen to further drop to 5.5%.  Germany's public finances are improving. Helped by robust economic growth in 2011, Germany has reduced its budget deficit to 1% of GDP. The government has proposed a major reform of the country's energy system, which aims at ensuring competitive energy prices, a high level of energy security and effective environmental and climate protection. In other areas, reform efforts have been limited, particularly as regards labour market participation, education and services. Germany faces a number of problems in the medium to long term. Demographic change will hamper its future growth potential and the sustainability of its public finances. The current account surplus has been narrowing gradually. Parts of the German financial sector remain vulnerable, and, in particular, some of the Landesbanken lack a viable business model. Shortages of skilled labour are emerging in some sectors while scope remains to increase labour market participation. The performance of the education system can be improved, in particular with regard to disadvantaged groups. The energy regulatory framework and the network infrastructure will have to adapt to deliver on the agreed energy reform. Problems of competition remain in the services sectors and in the network industries, in particular in the railway sector. 3
