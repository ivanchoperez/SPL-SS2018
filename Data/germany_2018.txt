 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Germany’s enduring economic upswing offers an opportunity for policy action aimed at fostering higher potential growth, which can prepare the country for future challenges. Boosting public and private investment, where gaps have been clearly identified, can help maintain the efficiency of the capital stock and raise productivity to prepare for future challenges such as new digital business models, low-emission transport and decentralised (renewable) energy production. Better involvement of the underrepresented groups in the labour market can help address the looming shortage of skilled labour stemming from demographic change. Boosting investment and expenditure in education, including lifelong learning, and in research and development are also key in raising long-term growth 
potential.(1) 
The German economy showed robust growth in 2015-2017, driven by domestic demand. Real GDP growth was at 1.9 % in 2016 and 2.2 % in 2017. In 2017, private consumption grew for the second year running by 2 %. Underpinned by the continued economic expansion, unemployment fell to a record low of 3.6 % by the fourth quarter of 2017, despite the growing labour force. Employment growth continued, with the employment rate reaching 79.1 % in the third quarter of 2017, as both demand for labour and the labour supply increased. Despite record low unemployment and high job vacancy rates, wage growth remains moderate. The positive output gap and high capacity utilisation are expected to spur investment. Inflation rose from 0.4 % in 2016 to an average of 1.7 % in 2017 on the back of rising energy prices. 
The budget balance continues to improve, while government debt remains on a downward path. In 2016, the government surplus reached 0.8 % of 
                                                          
(1) This report assesses Germany’s economy in the light of the European Commission’s Annual Growth Survey published on 22 November 2017. In the survey, the Commission calls on EU Member States to implement reforms to make the European economy more productive, resilient and inclusive. In so doing, Member States should focus their efforts on the three elements of the virtuous triangle of economic policy - boosting investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies. At the same time, the Commission published the Alert Mechanism Report (AMR) that initiated the seventh round of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure. The AMR found that Germany warranted an in-depth review, which is presented in this report.  
GDP, higher than in 2015, rising further to a record high of 1.2 % of GDP in 2017, partly due to lower interest payments on public debt. The budget is expected to remain in surplus in headline and structural terms in 2018 and 2019 as well. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall further from 68.1 % in 2016 to below the 60 % Maastricht threshold over the next couple of years, possibly by 2019. 
Given its economic importance and strong integration in EU value chains, Germany is a source of potentially significant spillovers to other EU countries. A further rise in domestic demand, including through higher public investment in R&D and education, would increase Germany’s actual and potential growth. It would also stimulate demand and GDP growth in other EU countries, including those that need to bring debt down.  
Germany has made limited progress in addressing the 2017 country-specific recommendations. Limited progress has been made towards achieving a sustainable upward trend in public investment, including public spending on education, research and innovation. Some progress has been made in addressing capacity and planning constraints on infrastructure investment. There has been limited progress towards stimulating competition in the business services and regulated professions, reducing disincentives to work for second earners and helping them to move into standard employment, promoting higher real wage growth, and reducing the high tax wedge for low-wage earners. No progress has been achieved in making the tax system more efficient and conducive to investment.  
Regarding progress in reaching the national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy, Germany is performing well on the employment rate, early school leaving and poverty, improving tertiary education attainment, investment in research and development (R&D), and increasing the share of renewable energy. However, it is unlikely to reach its national indicative energy efficiency and climate targets by 2020. 
Germany performs relatively well on the indicators of the Social Scoreboard supporting the European Pillar of Social Rights. It has very low unemployment but a large gender employment gap. Strong social dialogue and a relatively advanced welfare model underpin Germany's competitive economy. 
The main findings of the in-depth review set out in this report, and the related policy challenges, are as follows: 
• The current account surplus is expected to edge down further in the future, but to remain high. Strong domestic demand is expected to keep import growth above export growth, further easing the current account surplus. The domestic saving-investment imbalance, which has been growing since 2008, may have reached a turning point in 2016. However, the factors keeping investment low relative to savings remain in place.  
• Demographic change and rising income inequality up to 2014 partly explain the rise and persistence of the current account surplus. Rising income inequality, linked to demographic and labour market changes, may have constrained private consumption and increased the trade balance. In addition, population ageing and concerns about the adequacy of future pension levels and old-age poverty could explain a rise in domestic savings. According to economic theory and model estimates, the demographic transition is currently pushing up the current account surplus by a substantial amount, but should lower savings in the long run. 
• Private investment has picked up, but business investment remains subdued as a proportion of GDP, suggesting that obstacles to investment persist. Housing seems to account for most of the increase in private investment, while investment in non-residential construction is slow to pick up. Though investment in machinery and equipment has increased to pre-crisis levels, as a share of GDP it remains subdued. On average, investment in intangible assets, such as R&D, has grown in importance. However, it is largely concentrated in medium-high tech sectors and in larger firms, while small and medium-sized enterprises and the services sector in general are tending to under-invest. This explains large 
Executive summary 
 
productivity gaps between manufacturing and services, which are likely to dampen potential growth. Despite favourable financing conditions, non-financial corporations remain net lenders. Barriers to investment include demographic trends resulting in shortages of skilled labour, taxation and administrative burden, regulatory restrictiveness in the services sectors and the shortfall in very-highcapacity broadband. 
• While public investment increased recently, the public investment gap remains large, particularly 	as 	regards 	investment 	in infrastructure and education. Real public investment growth turned positive in 2015, after showing negative growth rates in the years 	before. 	This 	improvement 	reflects government efforts to boost investment. The accumulated investment backlog at municipal level fell to some extent in 2016, but remains large at an estimated 4 % of GDP. The biggest shortfalls are in education, where the national spending target has not been met, and in infrastructure. While the Federal Government and 	the Länder 	kept 	their 	construction investment 	stable, 	such 	investment 	by municipalities fell steadily, with negative net investment also in 2017. Investment in public infrastructure is still held back by capacity and planning 	constraints 	at 	municipal 	level. Measures to overcome these have yet to show results. In addition, there is scope for enhancing 	digital 	public 	services 	and improving public procurement. 
• Germany is lagging behind on very-highcapacity broadband deployment, and the digital divide between urban and rural areas remains a particular challenge. Only a comparatively small proportion of German territory is covered by fibre-based access networks. Instead, upgrading existing copper cable networks continues to be the dominating incumbent's preferred technological solution. However, many services rely on very high connectivity. Lack of such connectivity holds back investment, especially by small and medium-sized businesses, many of which are located in semi-rural and rural areas. 
• Germany's tax and social security systems are not particularly progressive or supportive of employment and private investment. There is a relatively strong emphasis on more distortive direct taxes, notably on labour income, while revenues from consumption and environmental taxes are lower. Household income and consumption are restrained by the high tax wedge on labour, especially for low earners. The statutory corporate tax rate is among the EU's highest. Taxes on inheritance and gifts allow large-scale transfer of wealth from one generation to the next and preserve the high wealth inequality. Healthcare efficiency could be improved by better integrating primary, ambulatory specialist and in-patient care and making better use of eHealth.  
• The banking sector is not very profitable, but the equity and leverage situation remains acceptable. Nationally aggregated profitability seems low, and ongoing consolidation is improving efficiency relatively slowly. Still, capitalisation ratios are satisfactory, and the non-performing loans' ratio is low, in the context of a relatively small loan stock, particularly for non-financial corporations. While the housing market continues to be buoyant, overall house price developments are not causing macro or financial stability risks. The venture capital market remains less developed than that of other international innovation leaders.  
• Wage growth remains moderate, despite record low unemployment and high job vacancy rates. The German labour market is performing well on aggregate, with strong employment growth and low unemployment. However, the prevalence of part-time work especially among women, and a large lowwage sector present structural challenges. Moderate recent wage growth is partly attributable to slow productivity increases in services, weak inflation expectations, low collective bargaining coverage in some sectors, and a reduction in structural unemployment.  
• Despite growing skilled labour force shortages, the labour market potential of certain groups remains underused. 
Executive summary 
 
Disincentives to work persist, particularly for second earners and the low-waged; they include the substantial tax wedge, tax rules, and the lock-in effects of the mini-job earning threshold. Long-term unemployment, though falling, remains sizable. An ageing population poses further challenges to the labour market, social policy and education in the medium to long term. Improvements in family and education policies, adult learning and in the integration of people with a migrant background into education and employment could reduce inactivity and in-work poverty, improve social cohesion and potential growth alike. 
• Germany has a solid social protection system overall, but there are concerns about the future. In 2015, the rise in the risk of poverty and inequality has halted and the income position of low income households improved. Nevertheless, future deterioration of pension adequacy in the statutory first pillar is expected to increase the risk of poverty in old age, especially for low-wage earners or people with atypical work and interrupted employment history. The gender pension gap is one of the highest in the EU. Social outcomes for migrants and their children remain a concern.  
Other key economic issues analysed in this report which highlight particular challenges facing Germany’s economy are as follows:  
• Germany's electricity networks are adapting to renewables production at a slow rate, and significant investment in transmission and distribution grids is still lacking. Substantial delays in carrying out many projects have incurred considerable costs to German and European electricity networks and electricity markets. The lack of north-south internal lines strains the electricity trade with Germany's neighbours, as domestic congestion tends to be pushed to the borders. Moreover, there is scope for higher energy efficiency in transport.  
• Progress on emissions reduction has been slow. Germany is expected to miss its Europe 2020 Effort Sharing Decision target for greenhouse gas emissions. The transport sector has been particularly slow to cut emissions of both greenhouse gases and local air pollutants.
