EXECUTIVE SUMMARY After a strong rebound in 2011, Latvia's GDP growth is expected to decelerate to 2.2% in 2012. The rate of unemployment dropped substantially in 2011 and is expected to decrease further to 14.8% in 2012 but youth and long-term unemployment rates remain high. The government has ensured financial stability and fiscal consolidation by over-achieving its fiscal targets. In 2012, the general government deficit is expected to decrease to 2.1% of GDP. In other areas, however, reform efforts have been limited, particularly as regards the public administration and the unified wage grid, management of state owned assets, strengthening of the competition framework, setting up of the Development Bank and outlining proposals for managing the EU funds in the new financing period. Latvia continues to face important policy challenges: building on the significant progress made regarding public finances, further fiscal consolidation is necessary to meet the medium-term objective to maintain market confidence. Latvia has one of the highest long-term and youth unemployment rates in the EU. There is a relatively high tax wedge on low-wage earners and a high level of undeclared work. A high share of the population is at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The coverage of unemployment benefits is low and the impact of social transfers on poverty reduction is small. Inefficiencies in the civil justice system have a negative impact on the business environment. The education and training systems are not adapted to labour market needs and not geared to improving Latvia’s innovation performance. Improving energy efficiency, in particular of the building stock, would contribute to growth and jobs, while reducing energy dependence.
