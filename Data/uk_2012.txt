1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, UK economic activity is expected to remain subdued, with growth of 0.5 %, before regaining momentum in 2013. Unemployment is forecast to reach 8.5 %. The UK is delivering its planned programme of fiscal consolidation measures, but the deficit is now projected to fall more slowly than previously expected, due to a weaker growth outlook in the medium term. The government has an extensive legislative reform agenda across financial regulation, planning, education and welfare.  Several structural challenges remain. Fiscal consolidation remains a pressing need and must be balanced with more investment, in particular to improve essential network infrastructure. Financing conditions remain tight, particularly for SMEs. Private debt levels are high and further deleveraging is necessary. Skills mismatches translate into higher unemployment levels, especially for young people, and the lack of high-quality and affordable childcare also contributes to the high proportion of workless households. There is a significant shortage of housing and house prices remain too high, which is linked to high levels of mortgage debt. The UK's persistently negative net export position calls for a strengthening of the non-cost competitiveness of the UK economy. 3
