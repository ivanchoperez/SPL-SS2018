1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY According to the Commission servicesâ€™ 2012 spring forecast, Slovenia's economic activity is projected to further contract in 2012, by 1.4%, before rebounding in 2013. Unemployment is foreseen to continue rising. No major structural reforms were taken in 2011. The latter part of the year was marked by early elections and the caretaker government took temporary measures. Slovenia lacked a fully-fledged budget for 2012 until mid-May, creating uncertainty, notably over the achievement of the 2012 deficit target. Following the early elections of December 2011, Slovenia is now in the condition to address the structural reforms it needs. The challenges already identified last year remain relevant in 2012. Indeed, the intensification of market pressures lends new urgency to credible and durable fiscal consolidation, cleaning of bank balance sheets and pension reform. Failure to overcome the other challenges could hamper the economy's adjustment and return to growth. Notably, labour market segmentation remains high in Slovenia and skills mismatches are being observed, with risks of transitions from short-term to long term unemployment. The business environment is not attractive enough for businesses and investors. Finally, given current policy settings, renewed economic growth could reignite wage developments detrimental to competitiveness. EN EN
