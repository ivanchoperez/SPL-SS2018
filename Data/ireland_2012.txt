EXECUTIVE SUMMARY IrelandÕs economy returned to modest, export-driven growth of 0.7 % in 2011. While employment contracted by 2.1% in 2011 as a whole, it grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in the final quarter of 2011. Unemployment is expected to reach 14.3% in 2012. Ireland has agreed an Economic Adjustment Programme with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund which aims at restoring the confidence of the financial markets in the sustainability of public finances and in the Irish banking sector, enabling a return to robust economic growth and market funding. Overall, Ireland has made important progress in programme implementation. The fiscal deficit target for 2011 was achieved and the 2012 budget aims for a fiscal deficit in line with the programme. By 2015, Ireland plans to reach a deficit below 3% of GDP. The recapitalisation of domestic banks has for the most part been completed. The deleveraging of domestic banks exceeded the programmeÕs targets for 2011. Sheltered sectors of the economy are being opened up with the publication of several reform bills, while steps are being taken in retail sector and to strengthen competition law enforcement. To address youth unemployment, the Irish authorities together with the Commission examined the possible measures for reducing youth unemployment, including through reallocation of the European Structural Funds.  Beside the adverse external environment and in particular developments in the euro area, major short and medium-term risks relate to obstacles to bank deleveraging and funding to the complexity of the reorganisation of the financial sector; and to the fact that economic activity may prove weaker than anticipated, putting  pressure on the budget.
