EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Italy's economic activity is expected to contract by 1.4%, and gradually recover in 2013. The unemployment rate is foreseen to increase further to 9.5% this year and 9.7% in 2013. In the past few months, the policy response to ensure sound public finances and tackle Italy's long-standing structural weaknesses has been determined and wide-ranging. It has touched upon a whole range of areas including taxation, pensions, competition in product and services markets, the business environment, efficiency of the public administration and recently, the labour market.   Italy continues to face important and serious challenges in a number of areas. The dualism in terms of economic development between the North and the South remains an overarching concern. The full implementation of the bold fiscal consolidation strategy is a pressing need. The weak external competitive position requires better alignment of wage and productivity developments. A heavy tax burden on labour adversely affects labour supply and demand. Reducing tax evasion and improving compliance require further determined action. Labour market participation and employment rates are still low, in particular for young people, women and older workers. The overall quality of the education and training system is unsatisfactory, with high levels of early school leaving and low participation in lifelong learning. Significant infrastructure gaps and a lack of competition in the network industries, in particular energy and transport, are hindering economic activity. The business environment is not growth-friendly due to administrative inefficiencies, burdensome regulations and significant weaknesses in the civil justice system.  3
