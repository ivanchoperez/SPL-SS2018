 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Economic growth in Slovakia is expected to decelerate to 1.8% in 2012, largely in response to weaker external demand. The situation in the labour market remains challenging and unemployment is foreseen to remain high at around 13% in 2012 and to decrease only slightly in 2013. Slovakia has introduced a set of reforms to strengthen the fiscal framework, improve the sustainability of the pension system and increase transparency of the judiciary and public procurement. In other areas, reform efforts have so far been limited, particularly as regards labour market and education. Slovakia faces a number of challenges: unemployment, particularly among the young and vulnerable groups, is very high, long-term unemployment remains the highest in the EU and the quality of the education and training system continues to be low. The tax wedge is relatively high for low-income workers and a non-negligible proportion of jobseekers have little incentive to move from social assistance to a low-paid job. The budget deficit remains high in light of the medium-term objective. Continuing consolidation and improving the quality of fiscal measures, also by addressing inefficiencies in the tax system and tax collection, remains a key challenge. Finally, public administration suffers from high turnover of staff and insufficient capacity building. EN EN3
