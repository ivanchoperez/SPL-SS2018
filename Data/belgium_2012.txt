 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012, Belgium's GDP is expected to remain broadly flat in the first half of the year, followed by a modest export-led recovery from the third quarter onwards. Unemployment is expected to gradually increase from 7.2% in 2011 to around 8% in 2013. Belgium has recently adopted reforms, including in key areas such as the labour market and pensions. It also introduced a budget for 2012 which helped in taking forward fiscal consolidation. Reflecting the outstanding challenges, some of which have become more acute, Belgium has announced plans to take further measures to pursue fiscal consolidation and strengthen structural reforms. Ensuring the reduction of the budget deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2012 remains an important policy challenge, as well as continuing to improve the long-term sustainability of public finances by curbing age-related expenditure. The evolution of competitiveness of the Belgian economy is worrisome, due to low growth in productivity and rising labour costs, with wage-setting and indexation mechanisms hampering efforts to limit real wage increases. Relative weak competitive pressure and some structural barriers remain in the retail sector and in network industries. There is room to complement initiated reforms of the unemployment benefit system in order to increase incentives to work, and to improve the effectiveness of active labour market policies, in particular for young unemployed, older workers and non-EU nationals. The financial situation of Belgian banks remains fragile. Finally, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from non-ETS activities, in particular transport, also appears to be a challenge for Belgium. 3
